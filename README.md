# Dotfiles

## What is this

This is just a folder containing my configs that I am making public incase I want to easily share it with other people, also incase I end up using another computer and I eaily want to transfer over my config files. I will try to keep this up to date, but who knows. 

## Ghostty 

This is a terminal that I am currently using on mac. It works pretty well and I just have some keybinds and colour schemes that I use. The configs can be changed by using super(cmd) + ,

## NeoVim

I use lazy as a package manager and these are just my nvim plugins in lua.

## Tmux

I use tmux on my terminal, and these are my keybindings and plugins I use so it works well with nvim.

## I WILL CREATE AN install.sh

eventually...
